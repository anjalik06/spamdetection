# 📧 Spam Email Detection using Machine Learning

This project is part of the **CodTech Internship - Task 4: Machine Learning Model Implementation**.  
The goal is to build a predictive model using scikit-learn to classify emails as spam or not spam.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Using a dataset of labeled emails, we apply machine learning techniques to detect spam.  
The model uses text processing and classification algorithms to distinguish spam from ham (non-spam).
